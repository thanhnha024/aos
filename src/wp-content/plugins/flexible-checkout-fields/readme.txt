The best WooCommerce checkout manager. Add, edit, remove WooCommerce checkout fields and customize WooCommerce checkout. WooCommerce checkout customizer.

Manage, reorder, hide, show, or add custom checkout fields with the plugin to customize the WooCommerce checkout page.

== Description ==

We think WooCommerce is the best ecommerce plugin for WordPress. But it lacks some very basic features like customizing checkout fields with a checkout manager in an easy to use interface. You can do it by hooks and filters but why bother if you can do it by Flexible Checkout Fields for WooCommerce - WooCommerce Checkout Manager. With this single page checkout plugin you can edit the default fields (change labels, hide, delete) or add your own checkout fields. You can set your own fields order. There are a lot of field types such as a checkbox field, a date field or a color picker field (some of them exclusively in the PRO version). Read on to see how easy it is to edit WooCommerce checkout fields with this plugin and how powerful it is.

Flexible Checkout Fields beautifully integrates with the WordPress dashboard. It is probably the best looking checkout field editor for WooCommerce on the market. And you can do some powerful stuff with it too. [See some screenshots ‚Üí](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-checkout-fields/screenshots/)

### Show or Hide Fields

You do not need a customer's phone number or second line address? Just hide the fields from the checkout and you're good to go. This is just one click away. Decide to show it later? Just another click and the field shows again. You can validate email too and hide WooCommerce price.

### Add New WooCommerce Custom Checkout Fields

### ü§î How can I customize the WooCommerce checkout page?

- **Step 1**: Install and activate Flexible Checkout Fields for WooCommerce.
- **Step 2**: Go to your WordPress backend, open the WooCommerce menu, and click Checkout Fields.
- **Step 3**: Choose the WooCommerce Checkout Section to customize.
- **Step 4**: Manage, reorder, hide, show, or add custom fields to the WooCommerce checkout page.
- **Step 5**: Use custom sections of the WooCommerce checkout page, more checkout fields, conditional logic, pricing per field, and additional options in **PRO**.

You can adjust the WooCommerce checkout page with custom checkout fields and this free customizer in a few moments üöÄ!

[**Read FAQ**](https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-checkout-fields/faq/) for detailed information about the plugin options.

#### üîÄ Fields Order

Just drag&drop to reorder checkout fields on the checkout page. You can reorder WooCommerce built-in fields as well as custom fields that you add yourself. Mix them any way you like or need. Simply customize checkout yourself. If other plugins add their custom fields in many cases you will also be able to rearrange them (if added properly by the plugin author).

#### ‚úÖ Field validation

WooCommerce has built-in validation of a phone number, an email address (validate email) and a postcode. We let you use this validation in the new fields you add to your store using this plugin.

Standard WooCommerce validation is not enough? You can add your own validation to any field you create in this plugin. You can find a code example in [Flexible Checkout Fields docs ‚Üí](https://www.wpdesk.net/docs/flexible-checkout-fields-pro-woocommerce-docs/)

#### ‚ùå Required or Optional Fields

This WooCommerce Checkout Editor will let you easily manage which fields should be required and which optional. Just click a *required* checkbox in the field settings and make a field required or optional. Works both ways.

#### üè∑Ô∏è Labels and Placeholders

Want to change *Company name* to just *Company* or *Your Awesome Company*? Just edit the label and it will instantly appear in the checkout page. **Pro tip**: You can also use HTML inside labels!

Want to give your customers a tip on how to fill a checkout field? You can do it with an explanatory placeholder (it will show inside the field). For example *Enter your full company name*.

#### üìÉ Display Checkout Fields on Other Pages

You can display the fields not only in the checkout page. Just mark a specific checkbox under the "Display On" tab as checked. You have 4 different locations to use:

* Thank You Page
* My Account - address
* My Account - order
* Emails

For custom fields, you may also decide about field formatting on pages/emails.

#### ‚ûø Custom CSS Class

Add some style to your fields. By adding a custom class to each field you can then uniquely style it in your theme's stylesheet.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Use your meta names

Are you a developer? You can set any meta name you want. This is the name of the field in the database. You can easily integrate this WooCommerce plugin for one page checkout with your custom code due to this function.

#### üåé Multilanguage ready

Flexible Checkout Fields (checkout manager) is compatible with WPML and Polylang and lets you translate fields data to other languages.

#### ‚≠ê Custom Field Sections (PRO)

Billing, Shipping or Order sections are not enough? Now you can add fields to 12 other checkout sections. Below you will find all sections and their corresponding hooks (hooks are just for developers' reference - if you do not know what hooks are, just ignore them and you'll be just fine - it will just work).

* Before Customer Details
* After Customer Details
* Before Billing Heading
* Before Billing Form
* After Billing Form
* Before Shipping Heading
* Before Shipping Form
* After Shipping Form
* Before Registration Form
* After Registration Form
* Before Order Notes
* After Order Notes
* Before Payment
* After Payment
* After Order Review
* Before Submit
* After Submit

#### ‚≠ê Conditional Logic for Fields (PRO)

**NEW:** You can also use the **PRO version** of the plugin to show, hide, and set a field as required based on multiple conditions üöÄ. We also give you the option to perform no action at all if one or more of the conditions you set is not fulfilled.

For example, set a VAT field to be required if the customer selects the company checkbox or is from a specified country. **You can also**:

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on:

#### üß© Shipping Methods

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on selected shipping method.

#### üß© Payment Methods

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on selected payment method.

#### üß© Products and Categories in Cart

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on products and/or categories in the cart, i.e.:

* Show engraving field for jewelery category
* Show delivery date option only for physical products
* Show VAT Number for digital goods
* Hide address fields for digital goods

#### üß© Cart value

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on product value in cart.

#### üß© Flexible Checkout Fields plugin fields

#### üß© Flexible Product plugin fields

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on other fields added with Flexible Product Fields.

#### üß© Default WooCommerce plugin fields

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on default Woo fields.

#### üß© User role

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on the user role.

#### üß© Date

Enable conditional logic (show, hide, set as required or perform no action) for fields based on the date you select.


This plugin is compatible with variable products.

You can set many conditions (OR) under one or more condition groups (AND) for each field. The conditional logic feature will help you in advanced WooCommerce checkout page customization üéâ!
